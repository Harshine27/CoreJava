REST API Introduction:
=====================
Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used

for creating web services.

REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simpleand flexible way without having any processing.

It's used to fetch or give some information from webservices.

All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP request.

Working:
========

A request is sent from client to server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET  or PUT or DELETE request.

After that,a response comes back from the server in the form of a resource which can be anything like

HTML,XML,IMage, or JSON.

But now JSON is the most popular format being used in web Services.


     
                       sendRequest(HTTP)

      Client ------------------------------------------>> Server

     
      Client<<---------------------------------------------Server

          
                        send response

                    (html,xml,image,json)

  In HTTP there are five methods that are commomnly used in a REST-based Architecture

  i.e POST,GET,PUT,PATCH,and DELETE..

  These correspond to create,read,update,and  delete (or CRUD) operations respectively.

 GET:
 ====

  the HTTP GET method is used to read (or retrieve) a representation of a resource.


  In the safe path,GET returns a reprsentation in XML Or JSON and an HTTP respnse code of 200(OK)


  In an error case,it most often returns a 404(NOT FOUND) or 400(BAD REQUEST).

POST:
=======

the POST verb is most often utilized to create new resources.

on sucessful creation,return HTTP status 201.

PUT:
====

It is used for updating the capabilities.

on sucusessful update,return 200(or 204 if not returning any content in the body)from a PUT.

If using PUT for create,return HTTP status 201 on sucuessful creation.


DELETE:
=======
It is used to delete a resource identfied by a URL.

on Sucuessful deletion ,return HTTP status 200 (OK) along with a response body.
